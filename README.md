# Narendra-MIT-project

A brief overview of Mit project.
- This project is inspired from my childhood game Ludo, where we used to play with my family and friends.
- In this game two playes will compete each other and at the end who reaches the center position first he is the winner.
- The game is arranged in a 5 X 5 matrix with 25 boxes.
- I have used a random generator for generating some number between 1 to 6, based on this genetrated number players positions are moved across the screen area.
- There are two buttons available in the game one for each, whenever a player clicks on the corrosponding button it generates the number and displays on the textbox and changes the player position.
- For example, if the generated number is 5 and current position of the player is 1st position then the next place of a player is 6 (i.e 5 + 1) and it continues through out the game.
- The game comes to an end when one player reaches the center position by completing one outer circle path and another is inner circle.
